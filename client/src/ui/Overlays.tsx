            arcs up and drops through the rim. A tap falls short and a full charge flies long. Hit someone with a ball or a dart and they react. Aim at the roomba and press <Key action="interact" /> for a happy spin.

            play you. The mouse (or the right stick) moves the paddle, up being towards the net; swing it through the ball for pace, forwards for topspin, back for backspin, sideways to curve it. Click (or{' '}
            <Key action="throw" />) to toss and serve. Games go to 11, won by 2, and land on the floor's leaderboard on the wall. <Key action="drop" /> or <kbd>Esc</kbd> puts the paddle down at any time. Now and then two

          <GuideParagraph section="dog">
            One dog roams the whole building, taking the elevator between floors now and then. Aim at it and press <Key action="interact" /> to pet it: it wiggles and follows you for a while (into the elevator
            too). Hold a ball and it watches it eagerly; throw it and it fetches it back to your feet. It naps on the couch or a rug when the floor is quiet, sits with anyone having a hard time (red checks, a third
            round of fixes, or a PR stuck for a human) and celebrates a merge with its author. Rename it in Settings.

            <Key action="interact" /> to put it under the spout, then press <Key action="interact" /> on the machine's round button. After a few seconds of grinding and gurgling it beeps: aim at the mug and press{' '}
            <Key action="interact" /> to take your coffee. You can take the mug out early (it keeps what it has).

          <GuideParagraph section="sipping">
            With coffee in hand, <Key action="interact" /> takes a sip wherever you're looking (except at the machine). A full mug is three sips: the last is one big gulp, and then you drop the empty mug.{' '}
            <Key action="drop" /> drops your mug at any time, and mugs can't be thrown. Aim at a dropped mug and press <Key action="interact" /> to pick it up again, coffee and all. Any mug that isn't full can go back under
            the machine for a refill.

          <GuideParagraph section="fridge">
            The fridge at the kitchenette's far end: aim at it and press <Key action="interact" /> to open it (the light comes on), and again to shut it; it also shuts by itself a few seconds after
            everyone has walked away, and beeps if it's left open. With the door open, aim at a snack and press <Key action="interact" /> to grab it: an energy drink, sparkling water, cold brew, a mate
            soda, cold pizza, a protein bar, string cheese or a chocolate bar. Then <Key action="interact" /> has a sip or a bite until it's gone, and <Key action="drop" /> gets rid of it. Each floor's
            fridge restocks one item every few minutes, and the agents raid it on their breaks too. The dog begs when you hold food. Leave the labelled tupperware alone.

          <h3><T>Sound</T></h3>
          <GuideParagraph section="sound">
            The office chimes when a PR is ready to merge, fails QA or gets merged, when someone hits an error and when a new teammate arrives. A merge on the floor you're on bangs its gong (by the whiteboard) and the
            whole floor cheers; press <Key action="interact" /> at the gong to bang it yourself. Every floor's jukebox plays in its corner: <Key action="interact" /> on it skips to the next song, and its red button
            stops or starts the music. Its Focus button switches the floor to the Focus station (lo-fi beats and ambient tracks for heads-down work) and back to all songs. While you look at it,{' '}
            <Key action="volumeDown" /> and <Key action="volumeUp" />, the mouse wheel or its own − and + buttons set its volume, from quiet background up to music that fills the whole floor; the meter on its card
            shows the level, and each floor keeps its own volume and station. The music dips under the gong, alerts and voices, and goes quiet while a panel or the phone is open and in the elevator. Wherever no
            jukebox can be heard, a quiet soundtrack follows the office's mood: soft and calm, a gentle pulse when the team is busy, darker under a red CI or a PR that needs you, slower at night, and a little
            fanfare after a merge (a bigger one on a streak). Every space sounds like itself, from the glassy lobby and the carpeted floors to the tiled kitchenette, the boxy elevator and the open balconies, and
            sounds behind a wall come through muffled. <Key action="mute" /> mutes or unmutes anywhere. Under the master volume, turn footsteps (yours and everyone's), typing (and the team's sighs and cheers), chatter (their babble voices), toys (balls,
            blasters, coffee and the roomba), alerts (the phone, the elevator, the gong and these cues), music (the jukebox), voice (messages read aloud), outside (wind, the city, birds by day and crickets at night,
            rain and thunder and the world's goings-on, heard out on a balcony or through an open side door, and the rain on the windows) and the soundtrack up or down on their own, or switch the soundtrack off. Your settings are saved in this browser.

          <GuideParagraph section="chatter">
            The team talks as they work: speech bubbles about what's really going on (a PR up for QA, a teammate asked to test it, tests going green, a merge conflict, a merge and a teammate's "Nice
            one!", coffee at the cooler) in a cute babble voice of their own, the same on every visit; the CEO's is lower and grander. At most three speak at once and the nearest win. Quiet says the news;
            lively also chats about what they're doing. Aim at someone with nothing to do and press <Key action="interact" /> to say hi (aim at their desk to open it). The Chatter slider above sets how loud

            an error for 10 minutes, the beacon on top spins (and the one on that floor's sign) with a calm chime: press <Key action="interact" /> on it to open the console at that card. The manager's console has it
            all too, under Mission control.

          <h3><T>Time-lapse</T></h3>
          <GuideParagraph section="journal">
            Missed the day? The manager's console → 📼 Time-lapse (or the screen by the lobby's hoop) replays it right here in the office at up to 600× speed, or just what happened while you were away. Merges still
            bang the gong. While it plays, <kbd>Esc</kbd> frees the mouse and <kbd>Esc</kbd> again goes back to the live office.

          <h3><T>Your phone</T></h3>
          <GuideParagraph section="phone">
            Press <Key action="phone" /> anywhere to pull out your phone. Text the CEO, approve or decline their team changes, see every project at a glance, or play Cubetris, Cable Snake or look after your
            Desk Pet while the team works. The red badge counts decisions and messages waiting for you. In the chat, and in an agent's terminal, <kbd>Enter</kbd> sends and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> starts a
            new line. To talk instead of type, hold the 🎙️ next to Send, or hold <Key action="talk" /> in the message box, and speak: your words fill the box to edit before you send (a tap of the 🎙️ listens until you
            stop talking, and <kbd>Esc</kbd> stops listening). With 🎧 Hands-free on, the phone listens for a few seconds after the CEO's spoken reply and sends what you say. Settings → Voice picks the browser's
            speech recognition or ElevenLabs.

          <GuideParagraph section="photo">
            Press <Key action="photo" /> (or 📷 at the top right) to freeze the office and fly a camera of your own: click the view to steer, <MoveKeys /> to fly, <kbd>Space</kbd> and <kbd>C</kbd> up and down,{' '}
            <Key action="rotateLeft" /> and <Key action="rotateRight" /> to roll and the wheel to zoom. Pick a filter, add depth of field, the logo, the floor and date, or move the sun to golden hour, then{' '}
            <kbd>Enter</kbd> saves a PNG (up to 4× your screen) and copies it. <kbd>V</kbd> records a clip with the office's sound, optionally slowly circling the gong, the whiteboard or someone. Unfreeze (
            <kbd>F</kbd>) to film the office live. The work carries on while you shoot, and <Key action="photo" /> puts you back exactly where you were. Shots and clips are kept in this tab's gallery and saved to your
            downloads, never uploaded.

          <GuideParagraph section="workers">

          <h3><T>Other visitors</T></h3>
          <GuideParagraph section="visitors">
            Everyone else with the office open (another tab, a colleague, your phone) walks about in it as a visitor with a lanyard, a name tag and a soft glow in their colour, and sees you the same way. Hold{' '}
            <Key action="emote" /> for the emote wheel: point at wave, thumbs up, clap, point or laugh and let go (a quick tap waves, <kbd>1</kbd>–<kbd>5</kbd> pick straight away). Middle-click, or{' '}
            <Key action="ping" /> on foot, drops a ping where you aim for everyone on the floor to see. The visitors are at the top of the who's-working list: <b><T>Follow</T></b> trails one with the camera, by
            elevator too. Your name and colour, and <b><T>Appear to others</T></b>, are in the manager's console under Settings → Profile; nothing about you is shared before you enter the office.
          </GuideParagraph>
          <h3><T>The CEO</T></h3>
          <GuideParagraph section="ceo">
            The CEO studies every new floor, writes its QA brief, turns your project briefs into issues and sets each floor's team size from its work. New agents and let-gos wait for your approval unless you
            set team changes to apply straight away (manager's console, Settings), and no floor grows past its most agents per floor.
          </GuideParagraph>
          <h3><T>Your team</T></h3>
          <GuideParagraph section="team">
            Each agent is a real coding agent running in its own terminal, working in its own git worktree. They're all the same kind of worker: any free agent takes whatever is next on the board, an issue to
            build, a pull request to test or one to fix. Walk up behind them to read their laptop, or press <Key action="interact" /> (or click) on a desk to open their terminal: watch it live, type into it, send
            them instructions, stop them or hand them an issue or a PR to test. Aim at an empty desk and press <Key action="interact" /> to add an agent, or click it and confirm.
          </GuideParagraph>
          <GuideParagraph section="qa">
            Every pull request is tested before it can be merged, in a fresh session, by an agent other than its author when one is free: they run the tests, click through the change in a real browser, and post a
            report with screenshots on the PR. If it fails, its author (or any free agent) fixes it and it's tested again.
          </GuideParagraph>
          <GuideParagraph section="setup">
            <b><T>⚙️ Setup</T></b>, at the top of their panel, changes their name, look, coding agent, model and effort. Changes apply from their next task, so nothing is interrupted. Open <b><T>What they’re told</T></b> there
            to read what the office tells every agent on each kind of task. The CEO's model, effort and prompt are in the console's CEO tab.
          </GuideParagraph>
          <h3><T>Coins, decorations and trophies</T></h3>
          <GuideParagraph section="coins">
            Every merged PR earns its floor coins (🪙 at the top right): 10 a merge, 5 more when QA passed it first time, 5 when its checks were green first time, and 10 for the third merge on a floor within an hour.
            Nothing ever costs coins but the catalogue. Spend them at the catalogue kiosk in the lobby; what you buy waits in the floor's 📦 decor box by its elevator. Take something out, walk to a glowing spot and
            press <Key action="interact" />: it snaps in. <Key action="interact" /> on a placed decoration picks it up to move it, and the box puts things away. The arcade cabinet plays your phone's games.
            Achievements fill the trophy shelf in the lobby: <Key action="interact" /> on a trophy says what it was for and when.
          </GuideParagraph>
          <GuideParagraph section="careers">
            Desks tell their owner's story: a plaque on the monitor for every merged PR, a gold star for ten first-time QA passes, and a plant, a photo and a desk toy that arrive with time on the team.
            Look at a desk for a moment to see its career card (or open <b><T>🏅 Career</T></b> in their panel); the console's Team tab compares everyone.
          </GuideParagraph>
          <h3><T>The whiteboard</T></h3>
          <GuideParagraph section="board">
            <b><T>Backlog</T></b>: open issues nobody has picked up. <b><T>In progress</T></b>: agents building issues. <b><T>In QA</T></b>: being tested or fixed. <b><T>Ready to merge</T></b>: QA passed, waiting for you. Press{' '}
            <Key action="interact" /> or click the board to assign, send to QA, merge and file new issues. When a PR merges, confetti bursts over the desk of the agent who wrote it.
          </GuideParagraph>
          <GuideParagraph section="stickies">
            Aim at a sticky and it lifts off the board: <Key action="interact" /> (or a click) reads it up close. <Key action="drop" />, or holding the click, peels a Backlog sticky off: carry it to a free
            agent's desk and press <Key action="interact" /> and they start that issue (the sticky goes on their monitor). A PR waiting for QA can be carried to a free agent's desk the same way, and they test it.
            Anywhere else,{' '}
            <Key action="drop" /> puts it back. Red strings join an issue to the one it depends on until that one closes, and the corner of the board counts today's merges, the time from issue to merge, the QA queue
            and anything that needs you.
          </GuideParagraph>
          <GuideParagraph section="preview">
            The big screen to the left of the whiteboard shows the floor's app once its preview is running: press <Key action="interact" /> or click it to open the app. With PRs open, its bottom row
            has a channel for each: aim at one and press <Key action="interact" /> to run that PR beside the main app (at most two PR previews run at once). In the viewer, <b><T>Compare with main</T></b> puts
            them side by side, and the PR's checks and QA report sit beside it.
